    <div class="tip">
        <h2>Maintain a Balanced Diet</h2>
        <p>Eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Limit processed foods, sugary snacks, and excessive salt intake.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <h2>Stay Hydrated</h2>
        <p>Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated. Avoid sugary drinks and excessive caffeine. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, and other health issues.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <h2>Exercise Regularly</h2>
        <p>Engage in regular physical activity to improve cardiovascular health, strengthen muscles, and maintain a healthy weight. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <h2>Get Adequate Sleep</h2>
